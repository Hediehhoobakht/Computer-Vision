# Denoising
The purpose of this exercise is to simulate image denoising by averaging. The Hubble Galaxy image (HubbleImage_Gray.png) is used for this purpose which is free of noise. we corrupted the image by adding white Gaussian noise which has zero mean and a standard deviation of 50 gray levels.
